This a general guide on how to build a custom Commander deck for playing on Cockatrice.
We suppose that the reader already know the basic rules of Commander and we will focus on explaining common building strategies and web ressources.
# Build your deck
## Setup
1. Create an account to create/store/share your deck on a deck building website. I'll be using [TappedOut](https://tappedout.net/)
2. Go to the deck creation page
3. Select Commander/EDH as the Deck format
4. Build your deck
## Chose a Commander
Commander's cards can be appealing in many ways:
- the art is beautiful
- the flavour is accurate
- you are involved in the card's lore
- the card's effect is fun
- the card's mana colour have mechanics you like
- the card's strategy is strong

So you should not have too much trouble finding one you like. However the most important criteria to chose a commander are the following:
- Playgroup compatibility\
  Talk to your playgroup to ask them what power level they want to play at and which limitations they put on the decks.
  Don't chose a Commander/Strategy that your playgroup won't want to play against. Controversial mechanics/strategies generaly revolve around reducing other players ability to play the game. Exemple: [Grand Arbitrer Augustin IV](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/221/grand-arbiter-augustin-iv), [Iona](https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/20/iona-shield-of-emeria)
- Strategy\
  You need to like the game plan of your Commander, and you need it to be solid. Most Commander can chose between multiple strategies that they can mix. The strategy will be the leading element during the deck building and the game, it's like the personality of your Commander, so it's much better if it's good and you like it. Don't let a cute face tricks you into wasting time on a Commander that has a bad game plan. Exemple: [Gallia](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/217/gallia-of-the-endless-dance) because there are [only 32 RG Satyrs](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/217/gallia-of-the-endless-dance) to chose from, and almost all of them suck.\
To know what are the different strategies for your commander, you can check the page of your Commander on [EdhRec](https://edhrec.com/). Then when you have set your mind on your Commander,  add this first card in your deck.
### Case Study: Chose a Commander
I'll be building a deck as an exemple during this guide. You can find all the different steps we are going to go through [here](https://tappedout.net/mtg-deck-folders/general-cmdr-deck-building-guide/).
#### Appeal
The spoiler season for FF is nearing its end so I choose a Commander from this set that without a doubt will attract your sympathy by it's art and strategy. I'm sure he as a fantastic lore, that is perfectly captured by the card effect, which create the perfect flavour. I don't know for sure though cause I only played FFX and didn't finished it. Introducing... [a new challenger!](https://edhrec.com/commanders/hildibrand-manderville)
✔️ Chose a Commander you like
#### Playgroup compatibility
I play in a casual yet competitive playgroup. Our goal is to win, but we avoid strategies or cards that prevent others from playing or make the game trivial. We also tend to avoid very expensive cards.\
My Commander seems like a truly perfect gentlemen in that he inherently don't win the game solo nor prevent other players from having their fun.\
✔️ Chose a Commander your playgroup won't hate
#### Strategy
At the moment I'm writing this, this gentlemen only have 56 decks since the extension isn't even out yet and he's not exactly the highest profile character in FF franchise. But we can see that Token and Aristocrat strategies are the most represented. But what are those strategies?
- Token is a mechanic where you create multiple small creatures with one spell. The token strategy is about flooding the board with small weak creature, and take advantage of their number one way or another.
- Aristocrat is a strategy about sacrificing creatures as a cost to gain powerful effects, triggering cards of your board that have 'on creature death ...' condition in the process\
Those two strategies seems made one for the other, and by looking at [EdhRec strategy page](https://edhrec.com/tags) we can see they are very common, so they seem to be great foundations for a solid game plan.

✔️ Chose a solid game plan\
Looking at the Commander text, those strategies are not too surprising. The Commander effect revolve around dying and coming back, creating a zombie token in the process. I can't wait to make this gentlemen die a thousand death and come back for more.\
✔️ Chose a game plan you like
## Get a 1st draft
### Reserve space in your deck for your economy
In order to play your cards, you'll have to draw them and pay their cost. In general, roughly half of your deck will be about generating mana (lands and ramp) and drawing cards. So start by putting 50 basic lands, evenly splitted in your Commander's colors, inside your deck as a reminder that you'll need that space for your economy. We will get back to it latter when we will have a clearer idea of cost repartition of your cards.
### Explore your Commander's card pool
#### Recognize card's value in a vacuum (to avoid bad cards)
You'll have to judge the power of the cards you'll put in your deck to avoid putting weak cards in your deck. In a vacuum, the cards power is about the rentability the card's effect given its cost. Concerning mana cost, for a standard deck:
- 1-2 is cheap: generally mana ramp, targeted removal, aggro creatures
- 3-4 is average: generally the core of your strategy
- 5-6 is expensive: generally board wipe, high impact spell, strategy big engine/pay-out
- 7+ is a whole medium/late turn: generally win you the game if you have a good board state, or put you back in the game

also there are cards that will have other form of cost:
- heavy-color requirements (ex: {R}{R}{R} instead of {2}{R})
- require discard
- require sacrifice

Try to keep those additional cost in mind when judging the rentability of a card.\
Sometimes, your strategy will invalidate some of those costs, for exemple:
- 7+ cost won't be as expensive if you're strategy is about producing mana
- heavy colour requirements means nothing if you are mono coloured

In such case, re-evaluate your vision of the rentability of the cards that have those cost.
#### Avoid the trap of the 100 cards pool
We are in one of the most exciting part of the deck building: the discovery phase. We will see a ton of cards we didn't know before, many of them with bright colours, clever designs and all of them would be cool in our deck. But remember, in the end we'll only put around 50 in the deck, so you'll have to keep a clear mind and try to select the ones that best fits your strategy. Otherwise, you’ll find yourself with a pool of over 100 potential cards, facing the tough task of narrowing it down to just 50, with every cut feeling like a small heartbreak. How sad.\
So you'll use your strategy as the criteria to select those cards, but what is your strategy exactly?
#### Find your core strategy
To help us stay focus we will start by taking notes of the keywords related to our strategy:
- note keywords from your Commander card
- look at the following sections on your EdhRec Commander's page
	- High synergy cards
	- Top cards
	- The 1st few cards of the other sections
	take note of the keywords/concepts you see a lot and the ones that also appear on your Commander card 
- get on your [EdhRec strategy page](https://edhrec.com/tags), filter by your Commander's colours and proceed like on your Commander page: note the most frequent keyword/concepts

Check on the internet the meaning of this words and concepts and try to see how they link to each others. By now you should have all the key concepts/words to build your core strategy. Try to build your core strategy with that. Start with something simple, you'll refine it later after you play the deck the 1st time. If you're not confident in your strategy, ask a seasoned player for advices.
#### Make a 1st draft with your strategy in mind
Now that you have better idea of the text you want to see on your cards, you can start to browse your Commander card pool. But how can you browse so many cards? The game exist since decades and they print cards like crazy!\
Here are my usual resources, you should already be familiar with most of them:
- [EdhRec](https://edhrec.com/)
	- your Commander page\
	  List of the most frequent cards in the deck that use your Commander. It's the best place to find obscure cards that have cool synergies with your commander, as well as Edh staple that work well in the context of your deck.
	- [your strategy page](https://edhrec.com/tags)\
	 List the most frequent cards in deck that use your strategy. Great to find staples of your strategy.
	 - your Commander's color staple page
	 - the card's page (more of a 2nd draft thing)\
	   By clicking on a card on the website, you'll access the card's page. It list the card played most frequently with that card. It's one of the best way to find original cards you wouldn't have thinked of
- [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/advanced)\
	You can browse the entirety of MTG cards by a plethora of criteria. You'll probably want to set the following one:
	- filter by your Commander colours
	- filter by Legal in Commander
	- sort by EDHREC Rank\
	It's a good idea to search for the keywords/concepts you noted earlier.

Browse those resources to your hearth content. Once it's done you should have a +70 bulk of cards to chose from.
### Case Study: Get a 1st draft
- Add 25 Swamp and 25 Plains to the deck

  ✔️ Reserve space in the deck for the economy
- Let's harvest some keywords/concepts now
	- [Commander card](https://scryfall.com/card/fic/83/hildibrand-manderville-gentlemans-rise): 
		- Creature type: Human, Detective, Zombie
		- Card and Permanent type: Token, Adventure
		- Mechanics: +1/+1
	- [Commander EdhRec page](https://edhrec.com/commanders/hildibrand-manderville):
		- Mechanics: death touch, menace, flying
		- Conditions: when creature...
			- ... enter the battlefield
			- ... dies
			- ... leaves your graveyard
			- ... with mana value 3 or less
		- Pay-out: 
			- you gain 1 life
			- opponent lose 1 life
		- Costs: sacrifice, pay/lose life
	- Strategy pages:
		- [Token](https://edhrec.com/tags/tokens/orzhov)
		- [Aristocrat](https://edhrec.com/tags/aristocrats/orzhov)\
		In this colour pair, those two strategies seems to be synonym. The keywords are the same as the one found on the Commander EdhRec page
	- [Commander's colors staples](https://edhrec.com/commanders/orzhov/staples)\
	 This colour pair has excellent control over the board

Judging by the keyword and the cards I've seen, my core strategy will be to:
1. Generate a lot of token that will...
	1. ... trigger "enter the battlefield" effect that will life steal/ping my opponents
	2. ... defend my life points, attack. They will be more efficient if they get +x/+x
	3. ... serve as tribute to sacrifices that will...
		1. ... generate some form of advantage: draw, mana, 
		2. ... triggers "when creature dies" effects that will life steal/ping my opponents

It won't be an issue for me to sacrifice creature or life points to maintain a strong economy. My win condition is to melt my opponent slowly through the pings, or attack them with a big army. I know that, of the 50 cards, the majority of them will serve to support my token economy. And the rest will probably be about sacrifice and triggering on "enter the battlefield" or "dies".
I have a weak point on my ability to control who I'm damaging. I'll be hard to find allies at the table. Also I'm very previsible on my win con. Maybe I can find cards/strategies that cover those weak points later.\
✔️ Find your core strategy
[Here is my 1st draft](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/1-1st-draft/), done while keeping my strategy in mind to help me filter the cards. I browsed the different pages of EdhRec to do so. Also, since I think the originality of this deck is that it can sacrifice it's Commander often, I [researched on Scryfall the cards that involved sacrificing legendary creature](https://scryfall.com/search?as=grid&order=edhrec&q=%28oracle%3Asacrifice+oracle%3Alegendary%29+commander%3AWB+%28game%3Apaper%29+legal%3Acommander). But I only found 1 card.\
✔️ Make your decks 1st draft
## Label your cards by their function/role
You now have a strategy and a bunch of good cards to support it but you need to chose which one to keep. To do so you will have to determine what are the function of your cards inside your deck, then label them with that function in your deck builder. This way, you'll be able to know if you need to add or remove cards that do that function.\
Let's have a look at those functions:
- Common function: almost every decks need card that fit this role
	- Support function\
	  Those cards are about drawing card and paying them.\
	  Function Labels: Land, Ramp, Draw, Tutor
	- Interactive function\
	  Those cards are about interaction with other players: defend your board and attack theirs.\
	  Function Labels: Control, Wipe, Defense
- Deck/Strategy dependent functions: card that fit a role that is specific to your deck
	- Core function (around 15-25 cards)\
	  Those cards do thing that your deck need to do consistently in order to work.
	- Pay-out function (around 7-14 cards)\
	  Those are your cards with the best impact, but that need your deck to comply with it's core function to be played at full potential.\
	  Those function labels generally looks like onXxx, whenXxx, ...
	- Complementary function (around 1-6 cards)\
	  Those cards are doing something that isn't the focus of your deck but that complement/synergize well with your core function.

Read your cards again with your strategy in mind, and focus on frequent keywords and formulations. The most frequent one that support the best your strategy represent the functions of your deck, use them as label.\
Now, by looking at the number of labels you have for each function, you should know the areas where your 1st draft is lacking.\
But there's "only" a 100 slots in your deck, and you're already well above that number. You can't just add more cards. It will soon be the moment to remove some of this cards to fit the 100, how many will fall? To know that we need to build the "Common function" part aka the mana base, card draw and interactions. Once you'll have that, you'll know how many slots are available for your deck dependent functions.
### Case Study: Labels your cards by their function/role
I added the common function labels to my deck, as well as those that are specific to my deck:
- Core function: Token (17), Sacrifice (18), Zombie (11)
- Pay-out: onToken (11), onDies (15), onEtb (8), onCreature (1), Ping (10), Lord (10)
- Complementary: Recursion (3), Mana (5), onPing (1)

Unfamiliar keywords explaination:
- onEtb: when a creature Enter The Battlefield
- Ping: deal 1 dmg to one/every opponent
- Lord: grant +x/+y or keyword to your main creature type
- Recursion: return creature from your graveyard to your hand/battlefield
- Mana: cards that provide mana without qualifying as Ramp (aka cheap spells that create permanent mana sources)

What can be learnt from those numbers:
- I probably want 1-3 more Token cards
- I probably have too many pay-outs, when I'll need to make a cut I'll remove the weakest one of them
- I currently don't have enough Zombies. This offer me two choices:
	- When searching for new cards, like additional Token cards, I'll will prioritize the one that make zombies
	- If I realize that there is not enough remaining slots in my deck to support a Zombie tribal gameplan, I'll consider Zombie as Complementary and cut the cards that tried to pay-off on them, like the zombie Lords

[Here](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/2-add-the-labels/) is the deck with the labels
## Build your mana base
The goal with the mana base is to strike the right balance between mana abundance and rarity. Without enough mana cards you won't be able to play your fun cards, and with too much mana cards you won't have card to play except mana. The right number of mana source will depend on how much our deck require mana to start working.
### Identify your deck's mana requirement
The idea is to know at which point you can play 2/3 of the cards in your deck. Usually, this is done by looking at the mana curve of your deck. The issue is that your deck is far from finished yet, so we will have to approximate it that way:
- look at your core function cards and order them by CMC (Converted Mana Cost)
- Identify the cards that falls at the two-thirds mark of your core function cards list, starting from the least expensive, and note its mana cost. That will be you're mana requirement for now.
### Build a mana base that meet your mana requirement
On EdhRec, on the page of your color, you can find a "Mana Staple" tab. It contains all the card that are usually used to build the mana base in your color, basic land excepted. But how many mana sources will you need in your deck?

| Mana requirement | Number of mana sources |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1                | 21                     |
| 2                | 29                     |
| 3                | 36                     |
| 4                | 42                     |
| 5                | 47                     |
### Speed up your mana base with Ramp
Your mana base will be composed of 2 type of mana sources:
- Land: you can play one max per turn
- Ramp: cheap (1-3 mana) permanent spells that tap for mana. Since you can play as many as you want per turn, it allows you to reach your deck's mana requirement faster. Which mean you can start playing for real faster.

Maximum number of Ramp spell

| Mana requirement | CMC 1+ | CMC 2+ | CMC 3+ |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1                | 0      | 0      | 0      |
| 2                | 8      | 0      | 0      |
| 3                | 15     | 7      | 0      |
| 4                | 21     | 13     | 5      |
| 5                | 26     | 18     | 11     |

This table contains the maximum number of ramp spell you can "replace" land with without getting mana screwed. But don't try to approach that number unless you have a specific strategy revolving around your ramp. Otherwise you will be paying mana sources that you could get for free.\
Keep in mind that CMC 1+ contains CMC 2+ that contains CMC 3+. It means that, for mana requirement 4 exemple, you can have up to 21 CMC 1+ ramp spell, and that among those 21, up to 13 of them can be CMC 2+ ramp spells. If you max out your number of CMC 3, then CMC 2, then CMC 1 ramp spell at mana requirement 4, you'll end up with 5 CMC 3, 8 CMC 2 and 8 CMC 1.
### Case Study: Build your mana base
My deck core function is the Token with 17 cards. So I'll look at the 11th card which is a CMC 4. Thus my mana requirement is 4.\
✔️ Find my mana requirements\
On my Commander's colors [EdhRec mana staple page](https://edhrec.com/commanders/orzhov/mana-staples) I can find the most interesting land to put in my Commander. Utility Land and Land on my [Commander Page](https://edhrec.com/commanders/hildibrand-manderville#utilitylands) can also contain interesting choices. So I chose the best land I can find in this page and build a 42 land mana base by removing excedent basic lands.\
✔️ Build a mana base that meet your mana requirement\
In theory, I could swap up to 21 of my lands for CMC 1+ ramp spells> But I prefer to stay below 11 ramp spells to avoid paying mana sources that could be free. Don't forget to check your [Commander Mana Artifact page](https://edhrec.com/commanders/hildibrand-manderville#manaartifacts)\
✔️ Speed up your mana base with ramp\
[Here](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/3-add-the-mana-base/) you can find my deck with the mana base
## Other common functions: Draw and Interaction
### Add Draw
During each turn upkeep, you draw a single card and your mana refreshes. To not waste that mana you'll have to play at least one card, and to build your mana base you would have to play one land. That's 2 cards used per turn for only 1 card drawn, so you can consider that your hand generally shrink by 1 card every turn. Since a game of Commander last many turns that mean you need to add card draw to your deck. Otherwise you won't be able to play card on your turn (not fun) because your hand won't contain nothing playable. Try to maintain the largest hand possible (maximum 7 cards) to have the greatest panel of options.\
The number and nature of cards draw you want in your deck depends on your deck:
- If you pay-off on card draw or play lot's of cards you'll need a lot of card draw, and you might be more interested in cards that draw a lot
- If you play only 1 big card each turn, you'll need less card draw, and you might be more interested in cards that filter your deck (scry, surveil, ...) before drawing a single card

As a baseline we will take the exemple of a deck that spend it's 3 first turn playing a land each turn, then uses 2 cards per turn. We will consider that his card draw are "Draw 2-3 cards", and we will try to make the player's hand don't go below 4 on the 10 first turn.\
That gives us a number of card Draw that's somewhere between those lines:

|                                              | Draw 2 | Draw 3 |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Pessimist<br>(Don't want to miss Draw)       | 19     | 16     |
| Optimist<br>(Take a 5% risk of missing Draw) | 14     | 11     |

So, if you you're card Draw potency is moderate (draw 2-3 cards) and you want to take moderate risk, 15 Draw cards seems like the right amount.
### Add Interactions
What is usually recommended is:
- 1-3 board removals
- 6-8 targeted removals
- 0-2 defense

But that's highly dependent on your preferences, strategy and playgroup:
- if you play control you'll need more removals
- if you invest all your ressources in one creature you'll need much more defense

It's tempting for newer player to skip this portion of the deck to "play nicer", but pack at least those 1 wipe, 6 targeted removals because you're going to need them. Keep them in hand for key moments so that it lead to comebacks and clutch moments that will be memorable. Or use them as revenge kill. Do what you want. Either way they will be the salt of your games.
### Case Study: Draw and Interactions
My deck isn't doing anything crazy regarding the draw, so I'm just putting those 15 Draw. I search for my best draw cards on the different EdhRec pages and I do a [search on scryfall](https://scryfall.com/search?as=grid&order=edhrec&q=oracle%3Adraw+commander%3AWB+%28game%3Apaper%29+legal%3Acommander) to see if I missed a good draw spell in my colors.\
✔️ Add Draw\
I'm putting the average value of interactions in my deck. So 2 wipes, 7 targeted removals and 1 defense. I'm trying to select the best one in a vacuum (instant speed, low cost, exile instead of kill, ability to target the maximum number of permanent, flexibility) but I also try to put the ones that synchronize the best with my deck (sacrifice, token generation)\
✔️ Add Interaction\
As always, [here is the deck at that step](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/4-add-draw-and-interactions/)
## Respect the 100 cards limitation
This is the hardest step. You now have to select your cards to respect the 100 cards limitations. But you have your strategy to guide your choices, and you already have the Common function cards locked in your deck. Good luck!\
When you have your 100 cards, change your basic lands so that you have the right balance in your colors. There are many tools on the web that will help you with that: here is [one](https://mtg.cardsrealm.com/en-us/tools/land-calculator) among others.\
When all is set and done I recommend you to analyze the power level of your commander in and communicate it to your playgroup. Here is [one tool](https://edhpowerlevel.com/) among others to do that.
### Case study: Respect the 100 cards limitation
I have to cut cards, so I decided to cut:
- cards that seemed weak to me
- the Zombie support part of the deck because I don't have enough Zombie to justify it
- greedy pay-out cards 
- I removed a 2 card combo that could trivialize the game

✔️ Respect the 100 cards limitation
[Here](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/5-respect-the-100-cards-limitation/) is the deck
## Tune your deck to your taste
Congratulations-you now have a playable deck! Feel free to skip this section for now and return after your first game if you prefer. In the following pages, we'll explore how to further personalize and upgrade your deck to make it truly your own.

As you play your deck, you'll understand it better and you certainly think of ways to improve it. This section is for compiling the different ways you could improve your deck:
- Re-evaluate your mana base\
  We built your mana base on a rough estimate a while ago, now that you have your mana curve quite set, you could calculate that "be able to play the 2/3 of your deck" rule.
- Focus on your core strategy\
  During the exploration phase, you selected cards that where going on different directions strategically. Now that you respect the 100 limitation, you might realize you don't have enough slots in this deck to support some of those strategies/functions. Remove those cards if they don't benefit your deck.
- Explore new cards for your strategy
	- In EdhRec, when you click on a card, you can see all the cards that are most often played with the selected card. So by browsing the cards in your deck on EdhRec you might find new interesting cards.
	- With Scryfall you can search specific keywords to discover new cards
- Swap your deck's Commander\
  That one is a bit sad, but the Commander that you selected back at the start of the adventure might not be the best at executing your deck's gameplan. Check [EdhRec strategy page](https://edhrec.com/tags) to see if there is a card that beat your Commander at their job. If you find a better one, you can always put your old Commander in the 99.
- Maximise your card's utility through the game
  A card's utility vary depending on your game state. The best cards are those that perform the best accross those 4 situations:
  - Development phase (20-25 cards)\
    The 1st part of the game, when players focus on building their boards and resources rather than winning. Ramp and mana rock are prime example of Development cards.
  - Behind state (8-13 cards)\
    Happens when player have better board/resources and threaten to win before you can. Interactions like board wipes are excellent Behind cards examples.
  - Parity state (10-15 cards)\
    Parity is when the players get in a stale mate where no one dominate the board so no one can afford to attack another player. The best Parity cards are the one that allow you to bypass the opponents defense or get a resource advantage.
  - Ahead state (3-8 cards)\
    You are in the lead when you have clear advantage over the other players, either through board state or resources. But with 3 other players at the table, you might not keep that lead for long once other players decide to take you down. That's why you need Ahead card to either:
    - Stay in the lead longer: cards that detter, prevent or neutralize opponents aggression
    - Win you the game faster: eliminate opponents or win you the game 

  Re-evaluate your cards with this Development/Behind/Parity/Ahead framework in mind. Avoid the cards that perform in only one case if it's already covered by other cards. Pick the cards that perform well in each situations.\
  This framework known as the [quadrant theory](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fU-BHhnihWs) and derives from a framework for evaluating cards in the limited format. However, when searching the term, you might not find it as your 1st search result. That's because, each time a Magic player have an idea in four parts, they call it a quadrant theory.
### Case Study: Tune your deck
[Here](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/6-aristocratic-gentlemen) you'll find the final version of my deck. As I play it the deck shall change with time but the strategy will stay the same. Now that I have mostly finished building my deck it's much easier to name it. Let's go with "Aristocratic Gentlemen" for this one.\
I also did an alternate version ["Gentlemen's rise"](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/7-gentlemens-rise) of this deck that explore a theme I did not kept for the main deck: the zombie token tribal. I built the deck for a playgroup that prefer lesser powerlevel.
